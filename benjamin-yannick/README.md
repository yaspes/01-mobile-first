## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This application is a simple website that mainly just has markup, and a little css. It was our goal to make this website responsive based on the current viewport. 

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
At this point, the app doesn't take user input. If they want to run the app on their own machine, they just need to navigate to the url for the site.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
For this application, we are using an html file and multiple css files that follow the SMACSS rules.
